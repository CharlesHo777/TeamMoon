This software is designed to meet the client's need of a web application that is able to facilitate an annual on-campus social activity called "buddy scheme." The main purpose of the buddy scheme is to pair up participating students for the purpose of mentoring. All currently enrolled or prospecting students of King's College London can join the buddy scheme, either taking the role of a "mentor" or a "mentee." However, general criteria for becoming a mentor include that a student is not a first-year or newly-transfered student. Also, a mentor should not be in a lower year than his/her paired mentee.

Team Mars Buddy Scheme can be considered as a simple tool or medium of socializing and making new friends. This can be very helpful for students new to the KCL community, as they may have this opportunity to be paired by the software to another student who has been in KCL for a while. The buddy scheme can enable new students to learn the rules and customs of KCL, to get advice on academics from old students, and to settle and integrate into KCL more easily. The scheme coordinator should pair up students of the same faculty or department. Such pairing conditions can be applied by the scheme coordinator using this software.
